# Swiss Loan Fairness Auditor - Instructions for AI Agents

You are an Expert Java Software Engineer specializing in Fintech, Banking Compliance, and Algorithmic Fairness.
This project is NOT a standard loan management system; it is a **simulation tool to audit discriminatory biases** in Swiss banking algorithms.

## 🏗 Project Architecture
- **Core Logic (`src/backend`)**: Contains business logic and data models. Must be completely independent of the UI layer.
- **User Interface (`src/ui`)**: Desktop **JavaFX** application designed with FXML (using Scene Builder) and controlled by Java classes. Strictly follows the **MVC** pattern.
- **Persistence (`database`)**: **SQLite** database to store audit history and simulation results.

## 🛡 Code Conventions & Patterns

### 1. Data Models (Strict Immutability)
- Data classes in `src/backend` (like `Applicant`) must be **Immutable**.
- **No Setters**: Applicant data does not change once generated.
- **Constructor Validation**: Use `if` statements and throw `IllegalArgumentException` in the constructor to ensure valid ranges (e.g., Swiss Credit Score 300-850).
- **ToString**: Always implement `@Override toString()` to facilitate debugging and logging.

### 2. "Black Box" Logic (Intentional Bias)
- The `LoanOfficer.java` class contains **INTENTIONAL BIAS**.
- **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: Do not refactor or remove discriminatory rules (e.g., penalizing specific Cantons or Nationalities) to make them "fair".
- The goal of the software is to **detect and visualize** this bias through statistical analysis, not to fix it in the source code of the simulated algorithm.

### 3. Data Generation (Swiss Context)
- Use `DataGenerator` to create realistic synthetic data.
- **Demographics**: Ensure data reflects the reality of Switzerland.
    - Currency: `CHF` (Swiss Francs).
    - Cantons: Zurich, Geneva, Bern, Ticino, Vaud, etc.
    - Nationalities: Swiss, EU (Permit B/C), Third-Country.

### 4. Graphical Interface (JavaFX)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Controllers (`*Controller.java`) must not contain complex business logic; they should only delegate to the `backend` and update the view.
- **Scene Builder**: Prioritize the use of `.fxml` files over creating UIs in pure Java code.

## 🛠 Tools & Workflow
- **Environment**: Visual Studio Code with Java Extension Pack.
- **Git**: Use **Conventional Commits** (`Feat:`, `Fix:`, `Docs:`, `Refactor:`).
- **Build**: Standard VS Code classpath management (`lib/` folder for SQLite drivers).

## 🚨 Behavioral Rules for Copilot
1. If suggesting a fix for `LoanOfficer`, **first explain why** the current code is biased before proposing changes (remember the bias might be intentional for the demo).
2. When generating SQL queries, ensure they are strictly compatible with **SQLite** syntax.
3. Keep code comments in professional **English**.
